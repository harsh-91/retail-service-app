# üß™ Test Guide ‚Äì Retail Management Platform

## 1. **Define the Scope \& Objectives**

- Test all business modules: Tenants, User, Inventory, Sales (incl. GST), Payments, Notifications.
- Ensure every service works *alone* and *integrated* (multi-service).
- Validate critical flows: onboarding, inventory, sale/udhaar/GST, payments, WhatsApp/push.
- Guarantee tenant isolation and compliance throughout.
- Catch regressions fast as new features are added.


## 2. **Prepare Your Test Environment**

- Stand up a dev/test environment mirroring production:
    - Each microservice running (suggest Docker Compose for simplicity)
    - MongoDB per service, clean test data seeding
    - Static files/PDF dir, WhatsApp/email stubs
- Use `.env` files for test DB URIs and secrets.


## 3. **Layered Testing Strategy**

### 3.1. **Unit Testing**

- Focus: Functions/methods/models in isolation (no DB, no network).
- Examples:
    - Calculation of GST/total for a single sale.
    - Inventory low-stock logic.
    - Validation (e.g. payment method, GSTIN format).
- **Tools:** pytest (Python), unittest.
- **How:** Mock DB/network, focus on business logic and edge cases.


### 3.2. **Component (Service) Testing**

- Focus: Each microservice‚Äôs full API, but running in isolation.
- Examples:
    - POST/GET `/items` in inventory, validate CRUD with test DB.
    - POST `/sales` in order service saves correct data (tenant_id enforced).
- **Tools:** pytest + httpx (Python HTTP client), Postman/Newman[^3][^6].
- **How:** Use Docker test DB or in-memory MongoDB. Seed test tenants/users/items.


### 3.3. **Contract Testing**

- Focus: API requests and responses between services conform to the agreed contract/schema.
- Examples:
    - Sales service expects `{ "item_id": str, ... }` from Inventory, Payment expects `{ "amount": float, ... }` from Sales.
- **Tools:** Pact (Python), schema validators.
- **How:** Run schema validation and test stubs/mocks for inter-service calls in CI.


### 3.4. **Integration Testing**

- Focus: Two or more real services talking to each other[^5][^3].
- Examples:
    - Place a sale in Sales; trigger stock reduction in Inventory; check both DBs.
    - Mark payment received; verify Sale is updated with amount in Sales DB.
- **Tools:** Docker Compose for multi-service startup, pytest, Fakes for WhatsApp/email.


### 3.5. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

- Focus: Simulate real user/business workflow across the full system[^2][^5][^4][^6].
- Examples:
    - Register tenant and user ‚Üí Add items ‚Üí Place sales with GST ‚Üí Collect payments ‚Üí Share invoices on WhatsApp ‚Üí Retrieve all via API.
- **Tools:** Postman, Selenium/Cypress (for UI), httpx, Playwright.
- **How:** Script full flows, ensure data consistency, check for user-isolation in queries.


### 3.6. **Performance \& Load Testing**

- Focus: Stability under heavy load.
- Examples:
    - Spike hundreds of sales/payments at once, monitor response times[^2][^5].
- **Tools:** Locust, JMeter, k6.


### 3.7. **Security Testing**

- Validate JWT is required by all endpoints.
- Ensure tenant_id isolation.
- Fuzzing for injection (headers/fields/URL).


### 3.8. **Observability Checks**

- Assert logs for errors, request traces, and DB writes are properly aggregated and tagged by tenant_id[^5][^4].


## 4. **Best Practices**

- **Test Early \& Continuously:** Write tests as you code (shift-left approach)[^5][^2].
- **Automate Everything:** Integrate tests into CI/CD. Run on every PR/build before deploy.
- **Isolate Data:** Each test scenario should create/clear its test tenant, user, and data.
- **Negative Testing:** Always check for unauthorized access, missing/invalid tenant_id, 404s, and permission errors.
- **Contract \& Schema Validation:** Run schema checks for every inter-service/API call.
- **Seed/Fixture Data:** Use test fixtures to reset and preload sample businesses/items/users.


## 5. **Typical Test Case Matrix**

| Service | Test Type | Example Case |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| User | Unit | Password hash/validation |
|  | Component | Register/login user (returns JWT, sets tenant_id) |
|  | Integration | Login, then access protected endpoint with token |
| Inventory | Unit | Item out-of-stock, threshold crossing |
|  | Component | Add/update/delete item |
|  | Integration | Sale triggers inventory deduction |
| Sales | Unit | GST calculation for sale |
|  | Component | POST /sales, expect correct total/udhaar field |
|  | Integration | Place sale, then mark payment received, verify update |
| Payment | Component | Create/list payment, check UPI/cash handled correctly |
| Notification | Contract | WhatsApp/send API called with correct phone/message |
| E2E | End-to-End | Register business, user, add item, complete sale, pay, invoice, share, check all APIs/DBs |

## 6. **Sample Tools \& Commands**

- **Unit**: `pytest`, coverage
- **API/Component**: `pytest` + `httpx` + test MongoDB or Postman
- **Contract**: Pact, Pydantic schema validation
- **Integration/E2E**: Docker Compose, Postman/Selenium
- **Load**: Locust, k6
- **Security**: OWASP ZAP, JWT lint
- **CI Example**: GitHub Actions `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
steps:
  - run: pytest --cov=.
  - run: newman run postman_collection.json
```


## 7. **Defect Tracking \& Quality Gates**

- Log any failures or regressions in your bug tracker (e.g. JIRA, GitHub Issues).
- Track test run results and code coverage in CI.
- Block merges if code coverage or test pass rates drop below agreed thresholds.


## 8. **Documentation**

- **Document test scenarios** in the `/tests/README.md`.
- **Provide sample API calls** or Postman collections for new flows.
- List **test tenants/users** and credentials for integration/E2E use.


## 9. **Real-World Example: Place, Pay, Invoice, Share**

1. POST `/tenants` ‚Üí receive tenant_id
2. POST `/register` ‚Üí get JWT
3. POST `/items?tenant_id=...`
4. POST `/sales?tenant_id=...`
5. POST `/payments?tenant_id=...`
6. POST `/sales/{sale_id}/gst_invoice?tenant_id=...`
7. POST `/sales/{sale_id}/share_invoice`
8. GET `/sales/{sale_id}?tenant_id=...` (verify all fields incl. gst_invoice, pdf url, share status)
